This is some example text of the program reading from a text file. the line here is quite long to demonstrate the wrapping of text in the ui, but currently the text wrapping is not dynamic. Yet.

In Phase one I recomend:
    - put all your units on base 1. 

In Phase two I recomend:
    - move the units back to home base.

In Phase three I recomend:
    - attaking both remaining bases split evenly.
