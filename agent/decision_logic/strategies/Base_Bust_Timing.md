- **Goal:** Convert thinned defenses into quick base kills to avoid prolonged trades and protect LER.
- **Assumptions:** Base has limited HP; Lights provide strong structure damage; Red defends close.
- **Action Controls:** **Lock** an initial approach; **Edit** to switch from defender trades to base focus at the right moment; **Delete** pointless chip once base is open; **Insert** short follow-ups.
- **When to use:** You can reach the base cleanly and expect to thin defenders without heavy losses.
- **P1:** Lock a clean approach to the chosen base; hold base focus until defenders are softened; then swap to rapid structure finish.
- **P2:** Insert an immediate transfer from the captured base toward the next nearest objective to keep momentum.
- **P3:** Insert a final, concentrated finish onto the last base without trickling in.
- **General:** Guard the screen while Lights finish; prefer a short, decisive base burn over extended skirmishing.
- **Risks & Mitigations:** Premature dive → wait for a better window; screen breaks → pause, re-form, then finish.
