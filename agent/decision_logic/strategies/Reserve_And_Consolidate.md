- **Goal:** Protect LER by avoiding marginal trades and committing only with local superiority; keep a small reserve to stabilise.
- **Assumptions:** Red won’t pursue far; you can disengage and re-form when needed.
- **Action Controls:** **Lock** single-lane pushes; **Delete** splits that expose Ranged; **Edit** to hold a small reserve; **Insert** only when superiority is clear.
- **When to use:** Totals are tight and you must minimise risk.
- **P1:** Lock a modest, safe approach on the easiest base; let Ranged do work behind a stable screen.
- **P2:** Insert a short push only when your formation is healthy; otherwise Edit to reinforce the frontline and reset the posture.
- **P3:** Insert the final push from the nearest held base once you clearly hold local advantage.
- **General:** Pause rather than feed losses; use the reserve to cover rotations and keep Ranged safe.
- **Risks & Mitigations:** Attrition creep → step back and rebuild; Ranged exposed → move reserve Heavy forward to cover.
