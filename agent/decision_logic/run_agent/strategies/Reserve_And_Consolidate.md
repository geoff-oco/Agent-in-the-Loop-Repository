**When considering moves to make to improve LER, keep the following strategy in mind:**

**Play conservatively: form a stable screen for Ranged, hold a reserve, and only commit when you clearly have local superiority, apply to all phases. If the line thins, reset and reinforce rather than feed, then launch the finishing push from the nearest held base once the advantage is secured, likely in phase 3.**
