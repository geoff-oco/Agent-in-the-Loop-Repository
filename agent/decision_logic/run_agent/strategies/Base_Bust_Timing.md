**When considering moves to make to improve LER, keep the following strategy in mind:**

**Focus on a clean approach to Red Base 1, soften defenders, then rapidly swap to letting Lights secure the kill on remaining units in phase 1. Chain momentum by immediately transferring pressure from the captured base to Red Base 3 in the next phase and close with a single, concentrated final push in phase 3 on Red Base 2 to avoid trickling.**
