**When considering moves to make to improve LER, keep the following strategy in mind:**

**Run a durable pin at Base 1 while a light probe tests base 3 in phase 1, then collapse decisively onto whichever side softens best in phase 2. Keep Ranged centered to retarget quickly, treat the probe as expendable, and finish with a single-axis mass push from a safe base to the weakest target.**
