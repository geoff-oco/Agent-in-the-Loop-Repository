**When considering moves to make to improve LER, keep the following strategy in mind:**

**Use a Heavy-led anchor to pin defenders while Lights time flank hits and Ranged chip safely from behind all at Base 3 in phase 1. After the first capture, in phase 2 roll your established flank into Base 3 and finish with a balanced push in phase 3 on Base 2 that keeps the anchor intact and Ranged protected.**
