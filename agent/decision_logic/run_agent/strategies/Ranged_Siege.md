**When considering moves to make to improve LER, keep the following strategy in mind:**

**Establish a disciplined siege lane through Base 1 or Base 3 where Heavies screen and Ranged grind from safety throughout phase 1 and 2, favouring steady attrition over risky dives. Rotate to refresh the screen, then transfer the formation to the next base once the first collapses in phase 3, letting Lights scout and finish.**
