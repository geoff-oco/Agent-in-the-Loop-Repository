**When considering moves to make to improve LER, keep the following strategy in mind:**

**Target Base 3 and commit a concentrated, screened push—Heavies first, Ranged protected, Lights held to finish—until it falls in phase 1. Pivot from the captured position to the Base 1 and close the map with a grouped, single-axis finish that avoids trickling in phases 2 and 3.**
