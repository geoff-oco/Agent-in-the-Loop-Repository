Rationale
This advice focuses on maximizing Blue's control while minimizing losses. By reinforcing successful strategies and reallocating units effectively, Blue can maintain pressure on Red bases. The emphasis on coordinated attacks, particularly on Red Base 2 from Red Base 3, is crucial for future success. The tradeoff involves ensuring that Blue does not overcommit to any single base, maintaining flexibility for future phases.
