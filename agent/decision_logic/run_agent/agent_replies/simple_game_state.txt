Simple Advice

Summary
Phase 1 shows a successful push on Red 3, capturing key units and controlling the base. Phase 2 indicates a partial retreat from Red 2, with Blue maintaining control but losing some units. Phase 3 consolidates control of Red 1, with minimal Blue losses and no remaining Red units.

LER: {} in favour of: Neutral

Phase 1
Red1
- Summary: Initial attack on Red 1 was neutral; some Blue units remain, but Red still controls the base.
- Lock: Focus on heavy units for sustained pressure; support with ranged units to keep Red 1 contested.
- Delete: Reduce Light units in favor of more Heavy or Ranged to maximize damage and control.
- Insert: Add more Heavy units to reinforce the push, especially from Blue reserves.

Red2
- Summary: Red 2 was not directly attacked; remains under Red control with high Red units.
- Lock: Maintain support units for Red 2, but avoid overcommitting; consider repositioning for future attack.
- Delete: Reduce Light units supporting Red 2, as they are less effective here.
- Insert: Reallocate some units to prepare for Red 3 attack or reinforce Red 1 push.

Red3
- Summary: Red 3 was heavily attacked and partially captured; Blue controls key parts but some units remain.
- Lock: Consolidate control with Heavy units, keep Ranged units protected for finishing.
- Delete: Limit Light units here; focus on sustained Heavy and Ranged support.
- Insert: Add more Heavy units to secure the base and prepare for final push.

Phase 2
Red1
- Summary: Red 1 remains under Blue control, with some units lost but key units intact.
- Lock: Hold current force composition; reinforce with additional units if available.
- Delete: Reduce Light units supporting Red 1, as they are less impactful.
- Insert: Add Heavy units to strengthen control and prepare for final consolidation.

Red2
- Summary: Red 2 was pushed back, with Blue gaining control but some units lost.
- Lock: Maintain support units; avoid overextension to prevent counterattack.
- Delete: Reduce Light units supporting Red 2, focus on Heavy and Ranged for control.
- Insert: Reallocate units from reserves to reinforce Red 2 or prepare for final push.

Red3
- Summary: Red 3 was heavily contested; Blue controls it with minimal losses.
- Lock: Hold current units; prepare to push towards Red 2 from Red 3.
- Delete: Limit Light units supporting Red 3, focus on Heavy and Ranged support.
- Insert: Add more Heavy units to secure Red 3 and facilitate final map closure.

Phase 3
Red1
- Summary: Red 1 is fully controlled by Blue with minimal losses; final consolidation achieved.
- Lock: Maintain current force; no further moves needed.
- Delete: Reduce unnecessary Light units; focus on Heavy and Ranged for efficiency.
- Insert: Reallocate surplus units to reserves or prepare for final map closure.

Red2
- Summary: Red 2 is fully captured; Blue maintains control with remaining units.
- Lock: Hold current units; prepare for map closure.
- Delete: Reduce Light units supporting Red 2, as they are no longer needed.
- Insert: Reallocate units to reserves or reinforce Red 1 for final push.

Red3
- Summary: Red 3 is secured with Blue units; final control established.
- Lock: Hold position; avoid overextension.
- Delete: Limit Light units supporting Red 3; focus on consolidating control.
- Insert: Reallocate surplus units to reserves or prepare for map closure.

Rationale
The strategy leverages a concentrated, heavy-first attack on Red 3, aligning with the target base crush plan. By securing Red 3 early, Blue can pivot to Red 1 and Red 2 with minimal risk, avoiding trickle phases. Maintaining support units and reallocating surplus units ensures sustained pressure while minimizing Blue losses. The approach balances aggression with safety, aiming for a decisive map control with minimal Red counterattack potential.

Notes
Focus on reinforcing Red 3 early, then pivot to Red 1 and Red 2. Avoid overcommitting Light units; prioritize Heavy for durability and damage. Support with Ranged units to maximize control and minimize Blue losses.
