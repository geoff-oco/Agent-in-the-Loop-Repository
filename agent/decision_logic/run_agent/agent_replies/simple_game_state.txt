Rationale
The strategy effectively prioritized Red 3, achieving a decisive capture early, which aligns with the plan to close the map from the south. Maintaining control of Red 1 and Red 2 with minimal losses reduces risks and preserves Blue's advantage. The focus on grouping units and supporting with Ranged units enhances safety and consistency, minimizing Blue losses while maximizing Red's exposure to attrition. The main tradeoff is potential overcommitment to Red 3, but the observed stability suggests this approach is sound given the current control status.

Notes
Ensure final pushes are well-supported with Ranged units to prevent Red counterattacks. Keep units grouped to avoid unnecessary losses and maintain map control.
