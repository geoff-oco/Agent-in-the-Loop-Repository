Rationale
This plan leverages initial concentrated pressure on Red 3 to secure a strong foothold, consistent with the strategy to target red3 first. Reallocating units from less contested bases minimizes unnecessary losses and prepares for a unified final push. The approach balances aggression with safety, ensuring Blue maintains a favorable LER while avoiding overextension into heavily defended areas. Risks include Red 2 resurgence if neglected, but the focus remains on decisive control of red3 and red2 for map dominance.
