- Lock: Maintain heavy units for sustained pressure; support with ranged units for safety.
- Delete: Reduce Light units at Red 1; they are less effective in direct assaults.
- Insert: Add more Heavy units to reinforce the push, ensuring Red 1's collapse.

Red2
- Summary: Red 2 remains largely uncontested; avoid overcommitting here, focus on other bases.
- Lock: Minimal movement; keep units ready for future attacks from Red 3.
- Delete: Avoid reallocating units here; Red 2 is not the current target.
- Insert: None.

Red3
- Summary: Red 3 is heavily engaged, with Blue units at or near control; continue the concentrated push.
- Lock: Focus on Heavy units first, supported by Ranged for safety.
- Delete: Reduce Light units at Red 3; they are less effective in this assault.
- Insert: Reinforce with additional Heavy units to secure the base.

Phase 2
Red1
- Summary: Red 1 is now under firm Blue control, with minimal Red presence remaining.
- Lock: Maintain a balanced force of Heavy and Ranged units for defense and potential expansion.
- Delete: Reduce Light units; they are unnecessary at this stage.
- Insert: Add Ranged units to support control and prepare for future pushes.

Red2
- Summary: Red 2 remains contested; Blue has some presence but Red units are still alive.
- Lock: Hold current units; avoid overextension.
- Delete: Reallocate some units away from Red 2 to reinforce other bases.
- Insert: Add Light units to probe Red 2's defenses and prepare for a future attack.

Red3
- Summary: Red 3 is heavily weakened but still holds some units; Blue maintains control.
- Lock: Keep Heavy units for sustained control.
- Delete: Reduce Light units at Red 3; focus on Heavy and Ranged for stability.
- Insert: Reinforce with additional Heavy units to finalize control.

Phase 3
Red1
- Summary: Red 1 remains under Blue control with minimal units; no further action needed.
- Lock: Maintain current force for defense.
- Delete: Reallocate surplus units elsewhere.
- Insert: None.

Red2
- Summary: Red 2 is still holding some units, but Blue has established dominance.
- Lock: Hold current units; prepare for final consolidation.
- Delete: Reduce Light units at Red 2; focus on heavier support.
- Insert: Add Ranged units for safe control and future push support.

Red3
- Summary: Red 3 is fully controlled, with minimal Red units remaining.
- Lock: Maintain Heavy units for final control.
- Delete: Reallocate Light units; they are no longer necessary.

Rationale
The strategy emphasizes a concentrated, heavy-first assault on Red 3, aligning with the target base crush plan. By securing Red 3 early, Blue can pivot to Red 1 and then close the map efficiently, minimizing phases of trickling. Locking in Heavy units at key bases ensures control, while reducing Light units prevents overextension. Reallocating units from less contested bases to reinforce critical points maximizes LER while maintaining safety. The approach balances aggression with consolidation, reducing risks of Red counterattacks and preserving Blue's advantage.
