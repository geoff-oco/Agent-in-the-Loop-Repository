Simple Advice

Summary
Phase 1 successfully initiated a concentrated attack on Red 3, reducing its control and setting up for a map-wide push. Phase 2 saw partial success with Red 2 weakened but still holding, while Red 1 remained contested. Phase 3 indicates Blue's focus on Red 3 is effective, but further consolidation is needed to secure the final position and maximize LER.

LER: 1.24 in favour of: Blue

Phase 1
Red1
- Summary: Red 1 remains largely intact, with minimal Blue pressure; focus on consolidating forces here.
- Lock: Maintain moderate support units; avoid overcommitting.
- Delete: Reduce Light units in favor of heavier units to sustain push.
- Insert: Add more Heavy units to reinforce the attack on Red 3.

Red2
- Summary: Red 2 is partially weakened but still controls key units; avoid overextension.
- Lock: Hold current units; support Red 2 with ranged units for sustained pressure.
- Delete: Reallocate some Light units away from Red 2 to reinforce Red 3 attack.
- Insert: Introduce additional Heavy units to break Red 2's defenses.

Red3
- Summary: Red 3 is heavily pressured, with Blue units controlling most of its forces.
- Lock: Focus on Heavy units to break Red 3's chokepoint advantage.
- Delete: Reduce Light units supporting Red 3; shift to support Heavy push.
- Insert: Add more Heavy units to secure the base in phase 1.

Phase 2
Red1
- Summary: Red 1 remains contested; Blue maintains presence but needs consolidation.
- Lock: Hold current units; avoid overcommitting further.
- Delete: Reduce Light units supporting Red 1; focus on Heavy and Ranged support.
- Insert: Add Ranged units to support final push on Red 1.

Red2
- Summary: Red 2 is significantly weakened but still holding; Blue should press for final control.
- Lock: Maintain Heavy units for sustained assault.
- Delete: Reallocate Light units away from Red 2 to reinforce Red 3 or 1.
- Insert: Introduce additional Heavy units for a decisive push.

Red3
- Summary: Red 3 is nearly eliminated; Blue units dominate this base.
- Lock: Consolidate units here for final push.
- Delete: Reduce Light units; focus on Heavy and Ranged for finishing.
- Insert: Add Ranged units to support final control.

Phase 3
Red1
- Summary: Red 1 is nearly captured; Blue maintains control with minimal losses.
- Lock: Hold current units; prepare to push into Red 2.
- Delete: Reallocate Light units to reinforce Red 2 or Red 3 as needed.
- Insert: Add Heavy units for final secure hold.

Red2
- Summary: Red 2 is now weak and vulnerable; Blue should finalize control.
- Lock: Support with Ranged units for precision attack.
- Delete: Reduce Light units; focus on Heavy and Ranged for efficiency.
- Insert: Add Ranged units to ensure clean capture.

Red3
- Summary: Red 3 is fully controlled; Blue can now consolidate for map control.
- Lock: Maintain Heavy units for map dominance.
- Delete: Reallocate Light units to support Red 2 or Red 1.
- Insert: Add Ranged units for support and safety.

Rationale
This plan emphasizes a concentrated, heavy-first approach targeting Red 3, consistent with the strategy to crush from the south. By focusing on Red 3 early, Blue reduces threats and gains map control, enabling a map-wide push. Reallocating Light units away from contested or weakened bases allows for resource concentration on Heavy and Ranged units, maximizing damage and control while minimizing Blue losses. The approach balances aggression with safety, leveraging chokepoint disadvantages to Red and maintaining flexibility for final consolidation.

Notes
Prioritize Heavy units for initial assaults, especially on Red 3. Use Ranged support to secure final positions and reduce Blue losses. Avoid overextending into Red 2 until Red 3 is eliminated, then focus on map control.
Model/User Strategy Discussion:

[2025-10-16 10:19] Ares: To improve your strategy, focus on accelerating the heavy unit buildup early on Red 3 to ensure a decisive breakthrough, as this base is key to map control. Simultaneously, avoid spreading light units too thin across Red 1 and Red 2; instead, reallocate them to reinforce heavy and ranged units where pressure is highest. Once Red 3 is secured, shift your attention quickly to finishing off Red 2 with coordinated heavy and ranged support, while maintaining a solid hold on Red 1 to prevent counterattacks. This concentrated, phased approach will maximize your LER advantage and minimize unnecessary losses.
