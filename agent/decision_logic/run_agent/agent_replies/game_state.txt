Rationale
Focusing on Red 3 allows Blue to eliminate a key chokepoint threat early, creating a safer approach for subsequent phases. Pivoting to reinforce Red 1 ensures a strong, consolidated push that minimizes overextension and trickling. Maintaining a steady buildup in Phase 3 balances aggression with safety, maximizing LER while avoiding risky overcommitment at any single point. The strategy leverages concentrated attacks and map control, but risks include potential overreliance on early success and underestimating Red's defensive adaptations.
