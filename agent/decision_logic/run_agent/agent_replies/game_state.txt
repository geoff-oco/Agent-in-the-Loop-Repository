Summary
Focus on a concentrated, heavy-unit push to capture Red 3 in phase 1. Secure and consolidate the position, then pivot to quickly threaten Red 1 from the captured base. Finalize by grouping units to encircle and secure Red 2, avoiding unnecessary phases.

Rationale
Focusing on a concentrated, heavy-unit push to capture Red 3 in phase 1 establishes a strong foothold and reduces Red's defensive options. Securing and consolidating this position allows for a swift pivot to threaten Red 1, leveraging the captured base for map control. Grouping units for a final encirclement minimizes unnecessary phases, maintaining momentum and limiting Red's ability to reinforce. This approach balances aggression with safety, avoiding overextension at chokepoints that heavily favor Red, thus maximizing Blue's LER while managing key risks.
