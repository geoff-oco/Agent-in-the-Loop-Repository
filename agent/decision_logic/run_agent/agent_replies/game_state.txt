Rationale
The concentrated push on Red 3 in Phase 1 secures an early advantage and reduces Red's defensive options. Transitioning to a grouped attack on Red 1 in Phase 2 maximizes LER by consolidating forces and minimizing overextension. Maintaining a single-axis advance towards Red 2 in Phase 3 ensures map control and a cohesive endgame strategy, though it risks overcommitting if Red reallocates defenses.
