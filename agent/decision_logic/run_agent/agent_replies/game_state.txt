Rationale
Focusing on Red 3 first allows Blue to secure a strategic chokepoint and eliminate a key enemy position early, reducing Red's defensive options. Pivoting quickly to Red 1 afterward consolidates control and prevents Red from regrouping or counterattacking effectively. Finishing with a grouped, single-axis push minimizes unit exposure and maximizes LER, though it risks overcommitting if Red reallocates units or defenses unexpectedly.
