Summary
Focus on a concentrated, heavy push targeting Red 3 to secure a quick base capture in Phase 1. Transition to a grouped, single-axis attack towards Red 1 in Phase 2, avoiding unnecessary engagements. Finalize map control by consolidating units and pressuring Red 2 from Red 1 in Phase 3 for maximum LER.

Rationale
Focusing on a heavy, concentrated push to Red 3 in Phase 1 quickly secures a valuable base, establishing map control early. Transitioning to a grouped, single-axis attack in Phase 2 minimizes overextension and reduces exposure to Red's chokepoint defenses. Final pressure on Red 2 from Red 1 consolidates gains and maximizes LER by maintaining unit advantage while avoiding risky multi-front engagements. This approach balances aggression with safety, leveraging chokepoint advantages and unit positioning to optimize Blue's strategic gains across all phases.
