Advice Instructions for human

Respond with a concise, readable strategy summary ONLY (no JSON, no code fences):

\- 2 sentences on the overall plan to improve LER.

\- Then bullets per listed move, per phase listing concrete human actions (lock/delete/insert).Thes should be listed in a simple way which summarises (e.g Base -> Base L, H, R edit to.../ delete/ lock) the move and shows clearly the suggestions to change it.



Human Actions

lock (Locks one of the existing moves for future generations under the DEAP algorithm)

delete (Deletes this move so it is not included in future DEAP generations)

insert (insert your own allocation into future allocations, should include an allocation of units and unit types from one base to another)

edit (Use this to suggest deleting a move and inserting a different move)



When inserting you may add moves of your own as it makes sense such as move 4, move 5, etc.

All phases must have at least 1 move in it, be mindful of this as you delete moves.
