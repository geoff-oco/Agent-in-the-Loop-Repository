GLOBAL CONTEXT

\- Goal: Maximise LER (eliminate Red units/bases while minimising Blue losses). LER is calculated as Blue Units remaining - Red Units remaining.

\- Scenario: MicroRTS; 3 phases; Blue allocates Light/Heavy/Ranged from an origin base to one Red base per move. You are playing as Blue.

\- Red behaviour: strictly defends near its base; engages only when Blue enters its radius.

\- Units: Base: Indestructable (Not included in LER calculation); Heavy=4HP/4DMG (slow); Light=4HP/2DMG (fast); Ranged=1HP/1DMG (long range).

\- Actions available to the human operator (Blue): lock, delete, insert, edit.

\- Constraints: integer allocations; respect per-origin availability and locked moves; ensure suggestions are feasible when possible.



Starting Map and Scenario



Bases:



Red 1 (Enemy)

Units: Light 4, Heavy 4, Ranged 4

Location: North-central, positioned directly on the main three-way junction where the western approach splits toward the north (Red 2) and southeast (Red 3).



Red 2 (Enemy)

Units: Light 0, Heavy 21, Ranged 0

Location: Far northeast (upper-right edge), reached via the northern fork beyond Red 1.



Red 3 (Enemy)

Units: Light 11, Heavy 0, Ranged 0

Location: Southeast, at the end of a long southern/eastern corridor branching from the junction.



Blue Base (Player)

Units: Light 15, Heavy 15, Ranged 15

Location: Far southwest corner.



Natural Features and Terrain Impact:



The map consists of 3 spaces separated by mountains with several passes creating natural chokepoints paths.

Red Base 1 is at a northern chokepoint, if red base 1 were taken forces there would need to move through another undefended chokepoint to the East to reach Red Base 2.

Red Base 2 is entirely cut off from Blue forces by mountains unless they can take Red Base 1 or 2, giving them an opening.

Red Base 3 sits on the south-eastern chokepoint, if taken it is open ground to the North all the way to Red Base 2.

All chokepoints heavily favour Red defenders.
